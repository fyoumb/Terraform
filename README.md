# Two-Tier Architecture with Terraform

This Terraform project deploys a two-tier infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform. The architecture consists of a public subnet with a web server and a private subnet with a database server. The web server can communicate with the database server, but the database server is not directly accessible from the internet. The database server can access the internet for patching. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- AWS account credentials configured on your machine with the necessary permissions.
- A configured AWS CLI profile (you can use `aws configure` to set this up).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-two-tier-architecture.git
   cd terraform-two-tier-architecture

2. Initialize the Terraform workspace: terraform init
3. Format the code: terraform fmt
4. Validate the configuration: terraform validate
5. Review and customize the terraform.tfvars file to set your desired values such as region, VPC CIDR blocks, and instance types.
6. Create an execution plan to review the changes that Terraform will make: terraform plan
7. Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure: terraform apply
8. Confirm the execution by typing yes when prompted or add "--auto-approve" to the command
9. Once the deployment is complete, Terraform will display the public IP of the web server and the private IP of the database server.

## Cleaning Up

To destroy the created infrastructure and release AWS resources, run: terraform destroy

## Customization

Feel free to customize the Terraform code to fit your specific requirements. You can modify variables, security groups, instance types, and other settings as needed.

## gitignore

When working with Terraform, there are several files and directories that you should consider including in your .gitignore file to ensure that sensitive or unnecessary files are not included in your Git repository. Below is a list of commonly ignored items for Terraform projects:

1. .terraform: The .terraform directory contains local Terraform state and plugin files, which can be quite large and are auto-generated by Terraform. It's a best practice to exclude this directory.

.terraform/

2. terraform.tfstate: The terraform.tfstate file stores the current state of your infrastructure. Since it can contain sensitive information and is typically managed remotely (e.g., in an S3 bucket for AWS), it should not be committed to the repository.

terraform.tfstate

3. terraform.tfstate.backup: Similar to terraform.tfstate, this file is a backup of the state file and should also be ignored.

terraform.tfstate.backup

4. .terraform.lock.hcl: This file is used by Terraform CLI to lock the versions of providers and modules. It's automatically generated and should be ignored.

.terraform.lock.hcl

5. .terraformrc: This file can contain configurations specific to your local Terraform setup and is not typically committed.

.terraformrc

6. .terraform.d/plugins: This directory contains Terraform plugins that may be specific to your local environment and should not be versioned.

.terraform.d/plugins/

7. .terraform/providers: Similar to the plugins directory, this directory contains provider-specific information and should not be versioned.

.terraform/providers/

8. .terraform/environment: If you use Terraform's workspace feature, this directory may contain environment-specific settings and should be ignored.

.terraform/environment/

9. .terraform/modules: If you're using local or custom modules, you may want to exclude this directory.

.terraform/modules/

10. terraform.log: This is a log file generated by Terraform. It's a good practice to ignore log files.

terraform.log

11. terraform.tfvars: If you store your variable definitions in a separate file (e.g., terraform.tfvars), you may want to ignore it. However, this depends on your project's conventions, as sometimes variable files are committed for documentation purposes.

terraform.tfvars

12. .terraform-version: If you're using tools like tfenv or asdf for version management, this file specifies the desired Terraform version and can be ignored.

.terraform-version
